I incorporated the NIST Cybersecurity Framework for this project. 

The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) includes five core functions: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover. 

1. Identify [Understanding and Identifying Cyber Risks]
Objective: I determine participants’ current awareness levels and identify potential vulnerabilities related to phishing.
Activities:
    - Conduct a phishing awareness assessment (turned this into a mini game) among participants to gauge their baseline knowledge.
    - Categorize participants into Low, Moderate, and High-risk levels based on their ability to recognize phishing attempts.
    - Identify common areas of weakness (e.g., suspicious link verification) -> key risks.

Outcome: A risk profile for each participant, showing their vulnerability to phishing attacks.

2. Protect [Developing Preventative Measures]
Objective: Establish educational safeguards to improve participants' awareness and resilience to phishing threats.
Activities:
    - Provide phishing detection training that includes common cues, such as verifying sender information, checking URLs, and identifying urgent language.
    - Distribute a "Phishing Detection Cheat Sheet" as a takeaway for participants to reinforce what they learned.
    - Emphasize safe practices, such as avoiding unfamiliar links and reporting suspicious emails.

Outcome: Increased awareness and knowledge among our club members, reducing the likelihood of them falling victim to phishing.

3. Detect [Monitoring for Phishing Vulnerabilities]
Objective: Identify signs of phishing vulnerability in participant responses.
Activities:
    - Analyze participant responses to assess their ability to detect phishing cues, especially focusing on those who missed critical indicators (e.g., suspicious links).
    - Create a risk assessment matrix that shows each participant's risk level (Low, Moderate, High).

Outcome: A clear understanding of which participants are more likely to be susceptible to phishing and what specific indicators they tend to miss.

4. Respond [Establishing an Incident Response Protocol]
Objective: Prepare participants to respond effectively if they suspect a phishing attempt or realize they’ve fallen victim.
Activities:
    - Develop a step-by-step incident response plan for participants to follow if they encounter a phishing email, including instructions to:
    - Report phishing emails to the IT department or a designated security contact.
    - Change passwords immediately if they’ve accidentally provided credentials.
    - Enable two-factor authentication for added security.
    - Simulate a phishing incident and practice the response process with participants to ensure they understand the steps.

Outcome: Make our club members (students) feel empowered and prepared to act if they encounter phishing attempts, reducing potential impact.

5. Recover [Facilitating Recovery from Phishing Incidents]
Objective: Help participants understand the steps for recovering from a phishing attack and ensuring continued security.
Activities:
    - Provide guidance on restoring compromised accounts and resetting security settings after a phishing incident.
    - Offer ongoing support through refresher training sessions and periodic phishing awareness simulations to reinforce learning.
    - Conduct a debriefing session after the training, discussing common mistakes and sharing additional tips for preventing future incidents.

Outcome: Participants are more confident in their ability to secure their accounts and recover from potential phishing incidents.

Summary of NIST CSF Application

By structuring my project around the Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover functions of the NIST, 
this provided me a comprehensive approach to phishing awareness and cyber risk assessment. 
Each function focuses on a specific aspect of cybersecurity management, making it easier for our WiCys club members (mostly beginners) to understand and apply.

Benefits of Using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)
    - Clear Structure: NIST CSF provides a logical flow, making it easy to follow and implement.
    - Real-World Application: Aligns well with practical cybersecurity tasks like phishing awareness and incident response.
    - Widely Recognized: Demonstrates familiarity with an industry-standard framework, valued by employers like the Port of Seattle.
    - Beginner-Friendly: Each function is straightforward, making it accessible to those new to cybersecurity.
