# Campus Phishing Awareness and Risk Assessment
October 2023 â€“ Cybersecurity Awareness Month

Women in Cybersecurity (WiCyS) Student Chapter, University of Washington Bothell

## Project Overview
This project, led by the WiCyS Student Chapter at UW Bothell, aimed to measure phishing awareness among members, identify risk levels, and provide recommendations for stronger cybersecurity practices. We assessed members' susceptibility to phishing in October 2023.

## Goals
Measure phishing awareness.
  - Identify risk levels among members.
  - Offer clear recommendations to boost security awareness.

## Participants
  - 20 WiCyS members completed a phishing assessment to help us gauge risk levels.

## Method
  - Assessment: Members responded to simulated phishing scenarios.
  - Risk Levels: Responses were scored and categorized by risk level.
  - Analysis: Results were reviewed for common vulnerabilities.

## Results
  - Risk levels were assigned based on phishing awareness.
  - Patterns emerged, showing areas for improvement.

## Repository Structure (based on NIST Framework)
/identify
/detect
/protect
/respond
/recover

## Key Findings
  - Members were most susceptible to disguised links and urgent language.
  - There is a need for stronger email security awareness and phishing training.
