# Campus-Phishing-Awareness-and-Risk-Assessment (October 2023, Cybersecurity Awareness Month!)
Women in Cybersecurity Student Chapter, University of Washington Bothell

This project was conducted as part of the Women in Cybersecurity Student Chapter at University of Washington Bothell. The goal was to assess phishing awareness among students (current members of WiCys Student Chapter in October 2023), identify risk levels, and provide recommendations to improve cybersecurity awareness.

### Project Overview
- **Participants**: 20 members, 5 officers for the term 2023-2024 (Lily, Margaret, Tammy, Sovanna, Chloe)
- **Method**: Conducted a phishing identification exercise with visual examples (in-person meeting), followed by data analysis.
- **Results**: Created a risk assessment matrix categorizing participants into risk levels (low, moderate, high).

### Repository Structure
- **survey-design/**: Contains survey questions and phishing examples used during the exercise.
- **data-analysis/**: Holds raw data, analysis summary, and the risk assessment matrix.
- **findings-and-recommendations/**: Includes the final report and presentation with recommendations.
- **visuals/**: Contains visual aids, including risk charts and campaign posters.

### Key Findings
- 50% of participants struggled with identifying suspicious links.
- Targeted recommendations were developed to enhance phishing awareness.
