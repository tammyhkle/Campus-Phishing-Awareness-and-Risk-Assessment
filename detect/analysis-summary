Phishing Awareness Project: Analysis Summary
Objective: My analysis aims to evaluate the phishing detection capabilities of students within a university setting and categorize their risk levels based on their performance. 
Key findings indicate areas of vulnerability that need to be addressed to improve overall cybersecurity awareness.

[Key Findings]

Risk Distribution:
    - Low Risk: 7 participants (28%) demonstrated strong phishing detection skills, making minimal errors. These participants consistently identified suspicious cues in phishing attempts, showing a good understanding of phishing indicators.
    - Moderate Risk: 12 participants (48%) showed moderate awareness but missed some cues, particularly in areas like sender verification and urgency language. This group requires additional training to strengthen their detection skills.
    - High Risk: 6 participants (24%) exhibited significant challenges in recognizing phishing attempts, often failing to detect suspicious links and verify sender information. This group is the most susceptible to phishing attacks and needs targeted training.

Common Vulnerabilities Identified:
    - Suspicious Links: 64% of participants struggled with identifying suspicious links. Many participants clicked on links without verifying their legitimacy, a major vulnerability in phishing defense.
    - Sender Verification: A notable portion of participants in the Moderate and High-Risk groups did not check or verify the sender’s email address. 
        This lack of verification increased their susceptibility to phishing.
    - Urgent Language: Participants in the Moderate and High-Risk categories often ignored urgency language as a potential phishing cue. 
        Phishing emails commonly use phrases like “Act Now” or “Immediate Action Required” to create a sense of urgency, which participants need to recognize as a red flag.

Impact of Prior Cybersecurity Knowledge:
    - Participants with prior cybersecurity knowledge were more likely to fall in the Low-Risk category, demonstrating a stronger awareness of phishing indicators.
    - Those without prior knowledge were mostly in the Moderate and High-Risk categories, indicating a need for introductory training in phishing detection.

Recommendations
    - Focused Training on Link Verification: 
        Provide specific guidance on how to verify links by hovering over them, checking for secure (HTTPS) connections, and avoiding links that lead to unfamiliar domains. 
        This training could help address the common vulnerability of failing to identify suspicious links.
    - Strengthen Sender Verification Awareness:
        Emphasize the importance of verifying sender information. Encourage participants to look closely at sender email addresses, especially in unexpected or unsolicited messages.
    - Educate on Recognizing Urgent Language:
        Train participants to recognize urgency language as a red flag in phishing emails. Providing examples of common urgent phrases used by phishers can help participants remain cautious.
    - Develop a Regular Phishing Awareness Program:
        Implement ongoing phishing simulations and refresher training sessions. Regularly testing participants with realistic phishing scenarios can reinforce learning and improve long-term phishing detection skills.
    - Targeted Training for High-Risk Participants:
        High-risk participants would benefit from additional, hands-on training focused on phishing recognition. Consider pairing them with more knowledgeable participants or providing one-on-one sessions to improve their skills.

[Conclusion]

This analysis reveals that while some participants have a strong understanding of phishing detection, there are notable vulnerabilities, 
particularly in link verification, sender verification, and urgency recognition. 

By addressing these areas through targeted training and regular simulations, the group can improve their overall phishing awareness, 
reducing their susceptibility to cyber threats.
